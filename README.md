# custom_raketasks

## Summary

Placeholder Gem for custom Rake tasks.

## Intention

This gem does not contain any functionality, but is intended
to be overridden by internally-served gems of the same name.

Just deploy your own Rake tasks as `custom_raketasks` on an internal
RubyGems repository and be safe of naming and versioning conflicts
as it will never hit a version 0.1.0 or higher.
